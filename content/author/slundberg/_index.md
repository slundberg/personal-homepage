I am a Member of Technical Staff at [Microsoft AI](https://www.microsoft.ai) (Health), and an Affiliate Assistant Professor at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). Previously I was a Staff Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google), and a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research). My work focuses on large language models, explainable artificial intelligence, and their application to problems in medicine and healthcare. This has led to the development of broadly applicable [methods](https://github.com/shap/shap) and [tools](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) for complex machine learning models that are now used in banking, logistics, manufacturing, cloud services, economics, sports, and other areas. I did my Ph.D. studies at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.washington.edu) of the University of Washington working with [Su-In Lee](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu).
